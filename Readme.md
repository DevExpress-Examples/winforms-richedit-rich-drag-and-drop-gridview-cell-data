# Rich Text Editor for WinForms - How to Drag-and-Drop GridView Cell Data

This example illustrates how to drag-and-drop GridView cell data to a RichEditControl document.

Handle GridView's MouseMove and MouseDown events to obtain the grid cell under the cursor position via the GridHitInfo object and get the cell's data.

In the `RichEditControl.DragOver` event handler, update the `RichEditControl.Document.CaretPosition` property value according to the current mouse position. In the `RichEditControl.DragDrop` event, just insert the stored text to the caret position and call the `RichEditControl.Focus` method to focus the RichEditControl.
